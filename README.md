## Current Projects

I have set this up to gather course work in one place. I am currently enrolled in a Professional Certificate in Coding course in Full Stack Development with MERN by MITxPRO via Emiratus.

I will be adding links to the individual projects in a seperate repo.

## Background

I have BA(Hons) in Fine Art and have been working as an AV and Specialist Equipment technician for the last few years. I am particularly interested, in interactive, generative and public art and the ways in which programming is used in art and design.
